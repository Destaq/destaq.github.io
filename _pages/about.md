I am a university freshman studying in the heart of New York, [2x author](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19271921.Simon_Ilincev), and dedicated programmer. I've been teaching myself full-stack software engineering for the past four-odd years, and am now fairly proficient at it with over four hundred stars to [my GitHub name](https://github.com/Destaq). Programs I write most often center around [language-learning](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lingotrack) or [productivity](https://github.com/Destaq/life-calendar), and often use Golang, Svelte, and/or Python.

Coding has always been a hobby of mine, and since early 2021 I have been putting time and effort into making that hobby a career â€” [view my resume](/downloads/Simon_Ilincev.pdf). Regardless of where the future takes me, I know that I'll be approaching it with confidence.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy digging up odd tidbits of history, learning Mandarin (I've [passed its most difficult proficiency exam](https://simonilincev.com/chinese/resources/guides/passing-hsk-6/)), and exploring the countryside with the family dog.
