I am a high school sophomore studying in the capital of the Czech Republic, a [2x author](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19271921.Simon_Ilincev), and dedicated programmer. I've been studying Python for the past three years, advancing to the level of intermediate/advanced with over two hundred stars to [my GitHub name](https://github.com/Destaq), and enjoy writing backend and utility programs.

Programming has always been a hobby of mine, and since early 2019 I have put time and effort into making that hobby a career path. Since then, the full breadth of the journey that a software engineer takes has been revealed to me, and I have taken on the challenge of pursuing my dream of becoming a full-time programmer.

Currently, I'm continuing in my Python studies both in and out of school, as well as learning Java and JavaScript on the side for the sake of knowing a statically + dynamically typed language and the ability to create websites to visually display my backend code.

Other than that, I enjoy writing fantasy novels, playing chess, and biking around the city.
