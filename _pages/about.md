I am a university freshman studying in the heart of New York, [2x author](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19271921.Simon_Ilincev), and dedicated programmer. I've been teaching myself backend software engineering for the past four-odd years, and have now advanced to the level of upper intermediate with over four hundred stars to [my GitHub name](https://github.com/Destaq). Programs I write most often center around productivity or language-learning, and often use Python, Vue, and/or Go.

Coding has always been a hobby of mine, and since early 2019 I have been putting time and effort into [making that hobby a career](/downloads/Resume_Simon_Ilincev.pdf). Regardless of where the future takes me, I know that I'll be approaching it with confidence.

Outside of programming, I enjoy digging up odd tidbits of history, learning Mandarin (I've [passed its most difficult proficiency exam](https://simonilincev.com/chinese/resources/guides/passing-hsk-6/)), and going on adventures outside with my dog.
