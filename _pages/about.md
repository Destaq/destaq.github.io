I am a high school junior studying in the capital of the Czech Republic, a [2x author](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19271921.Simon_Ilincev), and dedicated programmer. I've been studying Python for the past three years, advancing to the level of upper intermediate with over two hundred stars to [my GitHub name](https://github.com/Destaq), and enjoy writing productivity and utility programs.

Programming has always been a hobby of mine, and since early 2019 I have put time and effort into making that hobby a career path. Since then, the full breadth of the journey that a software engineer takes has been revealed to me, and I have taken on the challenge of pursuing my dream of becoming a full-time programmer.

Currently, I'm continuing in my Python studies both in and out of school, as well as learning JavaScript and Vue in order to create full-stack web applications.

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading novels, learning Mandarin, and VR.
