I am a high school senior studying in the capital of the Czech Republic, [2x author](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19271921.Simon_Ilincev), and dedicated programmer. I've been studying Python for the past four years, and have now advanced to the level of upper intermediate with over three hundred stars to [my GitHub name](https://github.com/Destaq). Programs I most often write center around productivity or language-learning, and often include dashes of Vue, Bash, and hopefully soon Go!

Coding has always been a hobby of mine, and since early 2019 I have been putting time and effort into making that hobby a career path. Regardless of where the future takes me, I know that I'll be approaching it with confidence.

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading novels, learning Mandarin, and swimming.
